\arguments{
\item{name}{Character of length 1, name of the target. A target
name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{set.seed()} on the result
to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{path}{Character of length 1 to the single `*.sql` source file to be executed.
Defaults to the working directory of the `targets` pipeline.}

\item{params}{Code, can be `NULL`.
`params` evaluates to a named list of parameters
that are passed to `jinjar::render()`. The list is quoted
(not evaluated until the target runs)
so that upstream targets can serve as parameter values.}

\item{format}{Optional storage format for the target's return value.
With the exception of \code{format = "file"}, each target
gets a file in \verb{_targets/objects}, and each format is a different
way to save and load this file. See the "Storage formats" section
for a detailed list of possible data storage formats.}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
stops and throws an error. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"stop"}: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.
\item \code{"continue"}: the whole pipeline keeps going.
\item \code{"abridge"}: any currently running targets keep running,
but no new targets launch after that.
(Visit \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html}
to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)
\item \code{"null"}: The errored target continues and returns \code{NULL}.
The data hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not
up to date for the next run of the pipeline.
}}

\item{memory}{Character of length 1, memory strategy.
If \code{"persistent"}, the target stays in memory
until the end of the pipeline (unless \code{storage} is \code{"worker"},
in which case \code{targets} unloads the value from memory
right after storing it in order to avoid sending
copious data over a network).
If \code{"transient"}, the target gets unloaded
after every new target completes.
Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
whenever another target needs the value.
For cloud-based dynamic files
(e.g. \code{format = "file"} with \code{repository = "aws"}),
this memory strategy applies to the
temporary local copy of the file:
\code{"persistent"} means it remains until the end of the pipeline
and is then deleted,
and \code{"transient"} means it gets deleted as soon as possible.
The former conserves bandwidth,
and the latter conserves local storage.}

\item{garbage_collection}{Logical, whether to run \code{base::gc()}
just before the target runs.}

\item{deployment}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}. If \code{"worker"},
the target builds on a parallel worker. If \code{"main"},
the target builds on the host machine / process managing the pipeline.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get built earlier
(and polled earlier in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}).}

\item{resources}{Object returned by \code{tar_resources()}
with optional settings for high-performance computing
functionality, alternative data storage formats,
and other optional capabilities of \code{targets}.
See \code{tar_resources()} for details.}

\item{retrieval}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
Must be one of the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"main"}: the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
and sent to the worker before the target builds.
\item \code{"worker"}: the worker loads the targets dependencies.
\item \code{"none"}: the dependencies are not loaded at all.
This choice is almost never recommended. It is only for
niche situations, e.g. the data needs to be loaded
explicitly from another language.
}}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()} to customize the
rules that decide whether the target is up to date.}

\item{deps}{Optional character vector of the adjacent upstream
dependencies of the target, including targets and global objects.
If \code{NULL}, dependencies are resolved automatically as usual.}

\value{
A data frame

\description{
Shorthand to include a SQL query in a
  `targets` pipeline.
}
\details{
`tar_sql()` is an alternative to `tar_target()` for
  SQL queries
  that depend on upstream targets. The SQL
  source files (`*.sql` files)
  should mention dependency targets with `tar_load()`
  within SQL comments ('--').
  (Do not use `tar_load_raw()` or `tar_read_raw()` for this.)
  Then, `tar_sql()` defines a special kind of target. It
    1. Finds all the `tar_load()`/`tar_read()` dependencies in the
      query and inserts them into the target's command.
      This enforces the proper dependency relationships.
      (Do not use `tar_load_raw()` or `tar_read_raw()` for this.)
    2. Sets `format = "file"` (see `tar_target()`) so `targets`
      watches the files at the returned paths and reruns the query
      if those files change.
    3. Creates another upstream target to watch the query file for changes
       '<target name> `sqltargets_option_get("sqltargets.target_file_suffix")`'.
